This project is a capstone project for the [codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/) data science course. 

In this project we look at membership data that is owned by a gym.
Technologies used in this project include:
- pandas for analysing the data
- sql for storing and querying data
- matplotlib for presenting findings in an intuitive way

We use statistical methods such as A/B tests to study the impact of different marketing approaches and study the data to deduce how the gym is gaining or losing revenue. A short presentation has also been put together to sumarise these findings.
